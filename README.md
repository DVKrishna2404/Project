Product Performance Analysis
Abstract:
The purpose of this project is to analyze product performance using sales data to identify key trends, top-performing products, and opportunities for improvement. The analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. Excel was used for initial data cleaning and preparation, while Power BI was used for interactive data visualization and insights generation. The final report provides clear visual representations of product sales, revenue, and performance patterns to support data-driven business decisions.

Introduction:
Every business needs to understand how its products perform in the market. Product performance analysis helps track which products are generating the most revenue, which categories are in demand, and how sales fluctuate over time.
In this project, sales data was collected from a company database containing product details such as product name, category, units sold, unit price, revenue, and date of sale. Using Excel and Power BI, this data was analyzed to identify sales trends, profitable products, and areas that need attention.


Objectives:
•	To analyze sales data to determine top-performing and low-performing products.
•	To understand sales trends over time (month-wise and day-wise).
•	To visualize product category performance.
•	To identify factors influencing sales growth or decline.
•	To provide insights for improving sales and business strategies.


Tools and Technologies Used:
•	Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, formatting, and basic analysis (formulas, pivot tables, charts).
•	Microsoft Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and visualizations.
